        const carInfo = {
            "oil change": "For optimal performance, change engine oil every 5,000-7,500 kilometers. Regular oil changes help keep the engine clean and lubricated, preventing damage and improving fuel efficiency.",
            "battery check": "Inspect the car battery terminals regularly for any corrosion. A healthy battery should last between 3-5 years. If you notice slow engine crank, dim headlights, or electrical issues, it might be time to replace the battery. Keep the terminals clean and securely fastened.",
            "tire pressure": "Maintain the recommended tire pressure, usually between 30-35 PSI (2.1-2.4 Bar). Proper tire pressure ensures better fuel efficiency, improved handling, and longer tire life. Check tire pressure monthly and before long trips. Don't forget to check the spare tire!",
            "brake issues": "If your brakes feel soft or make noise, it's crucial to check the brake fluid and pads. Squeaking or grinding noises indicate that the brake pads may be worn out. Regular maintenance of the braking system ensures your safety on the road.",
            "engine trouble": "If the check engine light comes on, inspect components like spark plugs, fuel filter, or oxygen sensor. These parts play a crucial role in engine performance. Ignoring engine issues can lead to more significant problems down the road.",
            "emergency contacts": "In case of a roadside emergency, always have the contact numbers for your car service provider, local towing service, and nearest police station handy. It's also beneficial to keep an emergency kit in your car that includes items like a first aid kit, flashlight, jumper cables, and reflective triangles.",
            "scheduled maintenance": "Regular scheduled maintenance is essential for prolonging the life of your vehicle. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for services such as fluid checks, air filter replacements, and timing belt changes. This helps catch potential issues early and keeps your car running smoothly.",
            "fuel efficiency tips": "To improve fuel efficiency, maintain a steady speed, avoid excessive idling, and ensure proper tire inflation. Removing unnecessary weight from the vehicle and using cruise control on highways can also contribute to better fuel economy.",
            "air conditioner issues": "If your car's air conditioner isn't blowing cold air, it may be due to low refrigerant levels, a faulty compressor, or a clogged condenser. Check the refrigerant levels and inspect the air conditioning system components.",
            "transmission problems": "If your car is having trouble shifting gears or making strange noises while shifting, it may be due to low transmission fluid, a worn clutch, or other internal transmission issues. Check the transmission fluid levels and consider getting a professional inspection.",
            "alternator failure": "If your car's electrical components are malfunctioning or the battery warning light is on, it may be due to a failing alternator. The alternator charges the battery and powers the electrical system while the engine is running. If you suspect an alternator issue, get it checked and replaced if necessary.",
            "cooling system problems": "If your car is overheating, it may be due to issues with the cooling system, such as a leaking radiator, a malfunctioning water pump, or a clogged coolant hose. Check the coolant levels and inspect the cooling system components.",
            "suspension issues": "If your car is experiencing a bumpy ride, uneven tire wear, or difficulty handling, it may be due to suspension issues. Check the shocks, struts, and other suspension components for wear and damage.",
            "headlight problems": "If your headlights are dim or not working, it may be due to a burned-out bulb, a faulty headlight switch, or an issue with the wiring. Inspect the headlights and replace any faulty components.",
            "exhaust system issues": "If your car is making loud noises or emitting unusual smells, it may be due to exhaust system issues. Check for leaks or damage in the exhaust pipes, muffler, and catalytic converter. A malfunctioning exhaust system can also affect engine performance and emissions."
